# onos-apps

This folder presents custom made ONOS applications written in Java, made while investigating SDN and whiteboxing.
The apps do contain some bugs, and are merely used as a proof of concept for different controller functionality,
written during my research.

In the app `/target/` folders, the `.jar` and `.oar` files are available to install on the ONOS controller.

Currently, we have the following apps:
* __My first app__, implementing a simple static loadbalancer
* An app implementing __basic VLAN support__, which can be applied in a reactive and static manner. This app also contains custom-made ONOS commands.

More information on the projects can be found in the `README` files of the projects itself.
